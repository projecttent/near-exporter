# Near Exporter

Prometheus exporter for Near Protocol nodes. Forked from [masknetgoal634](https://github.com/masknetgoal634/near-prometheus-exporter).

This service exports various metrics from Near node for consumption by [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io). It uses [JSON-RPC](https://docs.near.org/docs/interaction/rpc) interface to collect the metrics. Inspired by [Ethereum Prometheus Exporter](https://github.com/31z4/ethereum-prometheus-exporter)

### Build

`./build.sh`

## Usage

By default the exporter serves on `:9333` at `/metrics`.
